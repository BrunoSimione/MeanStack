# Week 7 Assignment
## Redux and Router

First, we need to create an react app `npm init react-app week7_assignment` and make sure to install the _react-redux_, _react-router-dom_, and _redux_ packages/dependencies.

Main points:
* Edit the [App.js](https://oddlylabs.com/brunosimione/ITE5430/src/master/week7/week7_assignment/src/App.js) to add the Provider, store, and reducer.
* Create the [actions](https://oddlylabs.com/brunosimione/ITE5430/src/master/week7/week7_assignment/src/actions/actions.js) and [reducer](https://oddlylabs.com/brunosimione/ITE5430/src/master/week7/week7_assignment/src/reducers/reducers.js) to handle the state update.
* Create the [components](https://oddlylabs.com/brunosimione/ITE5430/src/master/week7/week7_assignment/src/components) to create the front and the actions/reducer calls.
* Create the [containers](https://oddlylabs.com/brunosimione/ITE5430/src/master/week7/week7_assignment/src/components/containers) that will encapsulate the mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.

The run the app `npm start` and see the magic!
