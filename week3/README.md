# Install Node.JS
We need to download and install the **Node.js** from the website https://nodejs.org/en/

# Check Node.JS version
```
node -v
```

# Check Node.JS installation
Create a .js file just to check if Node.js is running properly

```
console.log('Hello Node!');
```

# Run the file
```
node index.js
```
If everything is ok, we will see the return of the program.
# MongoDB Installation/Dependencies
```
npm install mongodb
```
This command will install the mongodb and its dependencies 
After this, we will have a folder (node_modules) and a **package-lock.json**

# Package.json
```
npm install
```

This command will run the utility that helps in the package.json file creation
